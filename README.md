# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Giving values to the point x1 and x2
### Step 2: 
Giving values to the points y1 and y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple
### Step 5: 
At last, print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: 
#RegisterNumber:
import math
l1 = [10,6]
l2 = [4,2]
dist=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print('{:.2f}'.format(dist))
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the python program to find the distance between two points is successfully executed.
